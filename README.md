# Hackaton - HACKATOOL - Back

Projeto back desenvolvido na participação do primeiro Hackaton 2019.

Be your objective innovating in solutions, recruiting people that aggregates value into your company, organizing life-changing experiences or any other interest it/you may have, having a effective way of extracting all of the data and results of this is something very valuable. And that is exactly what HackaTool does, in a simple way, letting you have more free time to focus on the HR part of this amazing experience! Our tool gives you information endpoints, where you can use them regardless of your methods. You aren’t restrained to a closed system nor to the limitations of a platform. Our tool is a generator, not a performer. That means you don’t need to shift your methods for what some platform wants, you can add the tool benefits to them!!!!
